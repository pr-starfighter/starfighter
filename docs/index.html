<P>
Project: Starfighter is an old school 2D shoot 'em up. In the game you take on the role of a 
rebel pilot called Chris, who is attempting to overthrow a military corporation called Weapco. Weapco
has seized control of the known universe and currently rules it with an iron fist. Chris can no longer
stand back and watch as millions of people suffer and die. He steals an experimental craft known
as "Firefly" and begins his mission to fight his way to Sol, freeing key systems along the way. The
game opens with Chris attempting to escape a Weapco patrol that has intercepted him.

<P><B>Start New Game</B><BR>
This will start a new game
</P>

<P><B>Load Game</B><BR>
This will bring up a list of currently available games to be loaded, along with the planet that
the game was saved in. This option is only shown when there is at least one saved game available.
</P>

<P><B>Continue Current Game</B><BR>
This will automatically load the most recently saved game. This option is only shown when there is
at least one saved game available.
</P>

<P><B>Options</B><BR>
This will show a list of game options. Options for sound, music and an auto save slot can be changed.
Music and Sound can be switched to either On or Off. The Auto Save Slot allows the player to select
a save slot that will automatically be updated when the player finishes a mission. This can be
switched from None to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. When this option is set to a number, that save slot will be
used to save a game at the end of a mission. Note that any currently existing game will be
automatically overwritten.
</P>

<P><B>Quit</B><BR>
This will quit the game. Quitting is immediate, without prompting (the game can also be quit at
anytime by clicking the close button of the window).
</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Loading and Saving Games</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Games can be loaded from the title screen. When there are saved games available, the option "Load
Game" will be shown. Selecting this will show a list of available games to be loaded. Select a game
from the list to load, you will then be taken to the Intermission screen. To go back, selected
Back to Main Menu.</P>
<P>Games can be saved in two ways. The first way is to save a game on the Intermission screen. Move
the cursor to the Save Game icon and select it. You will see a list of five game slots that can be
used to save a game to. Click one of these and then click the "Save" button to save the game. The
second way is to use the Auto Save function. This will automatically save your game after you have
successfully completed a mission. To make use of this feature you must choose a save slot that
you wish to auto save into. This can be done on the title screen in the options section or on
the intermission screen at the options section.</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Getting Missions</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>In each System, the player can get missions by going to the Comms section of the Intermission
screen. Here allies will inform you of tasks that need to be performed and what planet these tasks
apply to. Once the player has decided which task they will perform, they must go to the corresponding
planet in the system (see Moving Around for more details). Once stationed at the planet
click "Start Mission" to proceed to the mission briefing screen. The "Start Mission" icon will not
be shown if the mission of the planet has been completed.</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Mission Briefing</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Before the beginning of each mission you will be presented with a mission briefing screen. This
will outline the mission's primary and (if any) secondary objectives. It will also inform you of
mission restrictions, such as time limits. Once you have read this, press ctrl or space to
continue</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Completing Missions</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Each mission in the game has one or more objectives tied to it. These objectives are either
Primary or Secondary objectives. In order to complete the mission, the player must complete all the
primary mission objectives. For example, when the game begins Chris is fleeing a WEAPCO patrol. The
primary objective for this mission is to destroy all the enemy fighters. Once this is achieved the
Firefly will leave the sector and the mission will be marked as a success.</P>
<P>One thing to note is that some missions will have both Primary and Secondary objectives. In this
case, the Firefly does not leave the sector if all primary mission objectives are complete and
secondary objectives remain. The player may then attempt to complete remaining secondary
objectives or press Escape to leave the sector. Secondary objectives are optional.</P>
<P>During the mission you will see messages appearing at the bottom of the screen. These messages
can be related to items that you pick up, as well as mission related information.<P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">White messages</FONT> are standard for picking up items such as cash and 
power ups<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Green messages</FONT> signify successful completion of mission objectives<BR>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>The Target Arrow</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
<IMG SRC="targetArrow.png" ALIGN="LEFT">
The Target Arrow can be used to locate enemies and point you in the direction that the enemy craft
is. You can toggle the Target Arrow on or off by pressing "T" on the keyboard. This arrow is very
useful for finding enemies that are evasive (such as transports) on missions that require you to
destroy all present craft. Simply follow the arrow to find the enemy. The arrow will not be displayed
when you are within the immediate vacinity of the target. On certain missions (such as Bosses) the
arrow will initially point towards a certain target that is part of the mission objective. The
target's current remaining shield is also displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
Please note that due to the nature of the game, the target arrow cannot be cycled through enemies.
</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Moving Around Systems</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>To play a mission in Starfighter you must be stationed at the relevant planet. To get to the
planet you require, you will need to click on the planet whilst viewing it on the Show System section
of the Intermission screen. Travelling between planets can be dangerous, but luckily Spirit is a 
peaceful place and there are no chances of interceptions, so travel is instantaneous.</P>
<P>Other systems are not as friendly and whilst travelling to a new destination the player runs
the risk of being intercepted by a WEAPCO patrol. After Spirit the player will select a planet
to travel to by clicking on it with the mouse. "Destination", followed by the planet's name
will appear in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. A new icon labelled "Go To Destination"
will also appear. Clicking this icon will make the player travel to the destination planet.</P>
<P>Travelling to new planets is represented at the bottom of the screen by the two planets (the
one being travelled from and the one being travelled to). A red bar will fill up as the journey
progresses. The speed the bar fills up will vary occurring to how far away the planets are from
one another. At any point during this time the planet can be intercepted (see Interceptions).
Once the red bar has filled up completely the journey will be completed and you will be
stationed that the new planet.</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Interceptions</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Interceptions can take place whilst travelling between two planets within a system. When the
player is intercepted they will go directly into a mission-like scenario. The objective of this
interception is to clear all attacking forces. Once this is done, the player will be free to
leave.</P>
<P>Interceptions also serve other purposes - Sometimes the WEAPCO patrol may have slave
transports with them. One of the objectives of a later system is to rescue a certain amount of
slaves. This is only possible during interceptions.</P>
<P>One important thing to remember is that any damage the player receives during an interception
will NOT be repaired until they have reached the destination planet. Therefore if the player
is heavily damaged during one interception that damage will still be present if they are
attacked again. This can make interceptions very dangerous.</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Weaponry and Upgrades</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>During the course of the game you will receive money. Money is gained from destroying enemy craft 
and picking up cash spheres in game (please be aware that due to the nature of the game cash is not
earned for destroying ships during Interceptions).</P>
<P>Money can be used to upgrade the Firefly and purchase additional ammunition for weapons. Items
can be purchased from a shop on the Intermission screen.</P>

<P><B>Temporary Upgrades</B>
<UL>Temporary upgrades are used to boost the Firefly's ability to be powered up. For example, at
the start of the game the Firefly can only be powered up to fire two plasma bolts are once. By
purchasing an upgrade for the Firefly, you can allow for power ups to enable you to fire a maximum
of up to five plasma bolts at once. Note that this only affects power ups and these will still be
ammunition limited. To upgrade your default weapon, you will need permanent power ups (see below).
</UL>
</P>

<P><B>Permanent Upgrades</B></P>
<UL>These power ups are more expensive than temporary upgrades, but are permanent. Whereas a temporary
upgrade requires you to make use of power ups on an ammunition limited base, permanent power ups are
not limited. This is highly useful when facing heavily shielded and tough opponents, with no means
of getting plasma ammo or transports in sight! When you power up your permanent weapon, your 
powered up weapon level will also be automatically upgraded if it is less powerful than your new
current power up level.<P/>
When the Firefly's Primary Weapon has been upgraded to its maximum output (3 plasma cannons) the
player can toggle the output type by pressing Shift. The output type can either be Concentrate (the
default firing type) or Spread. Various situations can call for varying the output type.
</UL>

<P><B>Secondary Weapons</B></P>
<UL>
As well as primary weapons and temporary upgrades, the Firefly is also capable of using a 
secondary weapon. At the start of the game this is a rocket launcher. Like the other weapons in the
game this can be upgraded by purchasing a new weapon from the shop. At the start of the game, a 
Double Rocket Launcher and Micro Rocket Launcher are available for purchase. Secondary weapons are
used in the same way the rocket launcher is used (Space to fire). However the Laser Cannon and 
Charge Cannon work differently.<P/>
Neither the Charge Cannon or the Laser Cannon are ammunition limited (unlike the other rocket based
weapons). The Charge Cannon works by the player holding down the Space bar and releasing it. A
meter at the bottom of the screen shows how much charge has been built up. The Laser Cannon works
by the player holding down the Space bar to fire a stream of laser fire. It is prone to over heating
and must be allowed to cool after usage.
</UL>

<P>Certain weapons and upgrades will not be available to you until later in the game, so remember
to save your money for them</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Item Spheres</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>When an enemy craft is destroyed they will sometimes release ammo and cash spheres. Certain
enemy craft will release power up spheres that can give your weapon a temporary boost. The following
are spheres that can be picked up during missions,</P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="cash.gif"></TD><TD><B>Cash Sphere</B> - Provides you with an additional cash bonus</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Cut Scenes</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>During the course of the game mini cut scenes will be shown after certain missions. These scenes
serve to extend the plot of the game and provide the player with gameplay tips. If you wish to
skip a cut scene press Escape. It is advised that you only skip cut scenes if you have already seen
them.</P>

<P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>Ending the Game</B></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>The game is over when the Firefly's shield units are reduced to 0 (zero), or a Primary Mission 
objective is failed. At this point, you will see the Game Over screen. To continue, press Ctrl 
or Space. You will then be taken back to the title screen. In certain missions the game will end
if Sid Wilson is killed.</P>

<TABLE BGCOLOR="#000099" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><B>About</B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Parallel Realities started off writing games on the Amiga using AMOS and then, later, Blitz Basic
2. Games written included the BOTSS Trilogy and most notably TANX Squadron. TANX Squadron was awarded
Amiga Format's contributor prize of the month in the summer of 1999. Project: Starfighter originally
started life on the Amiga but was never completed. Development began again for Linux in 2002 with this
being our first C program. The game matured quickly from the initial ideas and this is the finished
product. We do hope you enjoy playing it.</P>
