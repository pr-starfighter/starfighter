Nice head gear! You shop at the same place as me, huh?
FACE_CHRIS
What the hell were you doing?! You could have gotten yourself killed!
FACE_PHOEBE
I'm looking for my sister. She vanished about a week ago. I was scouting the area when I was attacked.
FACE_PHOEBE
Hey! Wait a moment! You're that rebel from Spirit! I think you're so cool! Can I come with you?
FACE_CHRIS
No way! You'd be too much of a liability!
FACE_SID
Chris, I think we could use the extra firepower to be honest. And I'm interested in studying her homing missile launcher.
FACE_CHRIS
Alright. But just don't get in the way.
