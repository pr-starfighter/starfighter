Chris, what happened?! Are you okay?!
FACE_CHRIS
We took down the WEAPCO mining vessel and then I was jumped by a man claiming to be a Kline Kethlan.
FACE_SID
I've heard of him. He's the Commander of WEAPCO's naval forces. One of the best pilots they ever had.
FACE_CHRIS
He did put up one hell of a fight. But I think he was toying with me. He left just as I was gaining the upper hand!
FACE_CHRIS
We've still got a job to do. What did you find out about Mordor?
FACE_SID
It's home to one of WEAPCO's main research facilities. They are testing some new fighter craft at the moment.
FACE_CHRIS
We should try and either destroy that or acquire it.
FACE_SID
Destroying it would be best. Word has also spread of your work and a small uprising has begun.
FACE_CHRIS
Then we'll help them. And after that we head to Sol.
FACE_PHOEBE
I wonder if my sister will be here...
