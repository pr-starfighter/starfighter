FACE_SID
Chris, what happened?! Are you okay?!
FACE_CHRIS
We took down the WEAPCO mining vessel and then I was jumped by a man claiming to be Kline Kethlan.
FACE_SID
I've heard of him. He's the Commander of WEAPCO's naval forces. One of the best pilots they ever had.
FACE_CHRIS
He did put up one hell of a fight! He didn't stick around for long, though. I guess he was just testing me.
FACE_CHRIS
Anyway, what's the scoop on Mordor, Sid?
FACE_SID
Well, it seems WEAPCO is testing some new fighter craft there. We should destroy it to thwart its development.
FACE_CHRIS
Sounds like a plan.
FACE_PHOEBE
I wonder if my sister will be here...
