I've just received another SOS. This one is coming from a supply craft that is under attack.

What's it carrying?
FACE_SID
A bit of everything, including some highly radioactive materials. It's not unlikely that as a result of the explosion some planets could be put into a life threatening situation.

I'll get on it.
