FACE_SID
We're nearly ready to make the jump to Eyananth.
FACE_CHRIS
That system is supposed to be full of slaves working under WEAPCO.
FACE_SID
Correct. It's got one of the highest mortality rates in the galaxy.
FACE_CHRIS
We know what we have to do there then.
FACE_SID
Just remember Chris that we won't be in Spirit anymore and travelling around could be dangerous.
FACE_CHRIS
So I'm going to run the risk of meeting WEAPCO patrols and convoys?
FACE_SID
Precisely.
FACE_CHRIS
We may actually be able to use that to our advantage. You thinking what I'm thinking?
FACE_SID
I sure am. I'll come up with a plan of action.
